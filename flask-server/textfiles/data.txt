According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too
small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black, Yellow, black. Yellow, black, Yellow, black. Ooh, black
and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Qoming! Hang on a second. Hello? -
Barry? - Adam? - Qan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Lookingl sharp. Use the
stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud
of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your
fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the
house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation, Never thought I'd
make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college, I'm
glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie,
growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not
going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he
could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's
why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today
we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please
welcome Dean Buzayygll. Welcome, New Hive Qity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our
ceremonies. And begins your career at Honsx Industries! Will we pick qurjah today? I heard its just

- Wonder
what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Hausx, a division of Honesca and a part of the Hexagon
Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the
point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the
nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adiusted and bubble-
contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That
girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Hones, we
constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet
technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the
Krelman, - What does that do? - Qatghes that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us
millions, Qan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones, But bees know that
every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick
for the rest of your life, The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just
work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say
that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haye.to make
